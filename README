iX (Extra Credit): Built-In Functions

April 25, 2020

At first, in implementing the built-in functions for this interpreter
assignment, I had wanted to go with the approach of having the user define these
functions similar to any other function, in order to remain consistent in how my
interpreter handled functions. That way, a user know that the only functions
available to them are the ones they declared. However, after more thought, I
wanted to be able to use the power of python's built-in math library, so
pre-defining the functions in the interpreter seemed like the way to go.

In order to use the python math library, I had to create a new node for each
built-in function and handle the built-in function calls in the parser, to
return those nodes instead of looking for a user-defined function. This proved
quite simple, as utilizing the math library allowed me to just evaluate whatever
expression was passed to the function, and then pass that value into the
library's function and return the result.
